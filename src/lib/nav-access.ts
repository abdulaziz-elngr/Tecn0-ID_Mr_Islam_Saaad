/**
 * Which permission(s) a dashboard page needs — used ONLY to hide menu entries and
 * to bounce people away from pages they cannot use. It is a convenience, not a
 * security boundary: every API route still enforces the permission on the server.
 *
 * A user may open a page when they hold AT LEAST ONE of its `any` keys.
 * The most specific (longest) matching rule wins; pages without a rule are open
 * to every signed-in user (e.g. the dashboard home).
